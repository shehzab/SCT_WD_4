# TaskOS – Advanced To-Do Web App

TaskOS is a feature-rich **To-Do App** created as part of my **4th task during the Skill Craft Technologies Internship**.
Unlike a regular to-do list, TaskOS includes advanced productivity features like task filters, reminders, import/export, and drag-and-drop reordering.
